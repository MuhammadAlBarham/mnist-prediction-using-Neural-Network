# mnist-prediction-using-Neural-Network

The aim of this project is to predict the number from the images.

## Dataset:
mnist dataset.

## Framework:

The framework that is used is [embedded keras api inside tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).


## Referances: 

* Main coded that I learned from is from [tensorflow-course from python engineer YouTube channel](https://github.com/python-engineer/tensorflow-course/blob/master/03_nn.py).
